# sqlalchemy-challenge
Background: 
Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with your trip planning, you decide to do a climate analysis about the area. The following sections outline the steps that you need to take to accomplish this task.

Objectives: 
In this challenge we are practicing our skills in using matplotlib and sqlalchemy. Not an easy task but a great way to understand the intricate details when using sqlalchemy. I had a hard time with errors in my code mainly coming from undefined names. I usedrefrences such as stack overflow and the general activities we have done in class to try and identify my mistakes and fix them with some luck. These defined named errors is something that has stuck out to me in my code journey. I am continuing to understand why these errors come about and working with sqlalchemy in general.
